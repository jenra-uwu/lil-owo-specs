LISP Interaction Layer syntax:

Definitions

a*  := zero or more of a
a+  := one or more of a
a   := literally "a"
<a> := a generic descriptive name

Main syntax forms

Top-level expression

  <operand> <arguments>*

where both <operand> and <arguments> may take the form of a General expression but NOT that of a Top-level expression.
A Top-level expression may only occur once per program so as to avoid syntactic ambiguity.

General Expression

  (<operand> <arguments>*)

where both <operand> and <arguments> may take the form of a General expression, an Atomic expression, a List Expression or a Vector expression.

List Expression

  '(<elements>*)

<elements> may take whatever syntactic form besides for that of a Top-level expression. In case of no <arguments> being provided, the expression '() will be valid and is called the empty list

Vector Expression

  [<elements>*]

<elements> may take whatever syntactic form besides for that of a Top-level expression. In case of no <arguments> being provided, the expression '() will be valid and is called the empty list

Atomic Expression
